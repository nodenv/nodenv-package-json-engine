The semantic versioner for Bourne Shell.

## Ranges

Every *version range* contains one or more *sets of comparators*. To satisfy *version range* version must satisfies all *comparators* from at least one set. Sets are separated with two vertical bars ``||``. Rules in each set are separated with whitespaces. Empty set are treated as wildcard comparator ``*``.

### Basic comparators
There are five basic comparators:

* Equal to ``=A.B.C`` (``=`` operator is optional, it may be provided but usually it isn't).
* Less than ``<A.B.C``
* Greater than ``>A.B.C``
* Less than or equal to ``<=A.B.C``
* Greater than or equal to ``>=A.B.C``

### Advanced comparators

##### Wildcards ``*`` ``*.*`` ``*.*.*``
Wildcard comparators can be satisfied by any version, even prerelease one.

Instead of ``*`` character can be used ``x`` or ``X``.

##### Wildcard ranges ``A.*.*`` ``A.B.*``
Wildcard ranges can be satisfied when only part of version is matching. In contrast to wildcards, wildcard ranges cannot be satisfied by prerelease versions.

* ``A.*.*`` is satisfied when majors are the same,
* ``A.B.*`` is satisfied when majors and minors are the same.

The special character (``*``, ``x`` or ``X``) is optional.

###### Examples
* ``1.2`` := ``>=1.2.0 <1.3.0``
* ``5.*.*`` := ``>=5.0.0 <6.0.0``

##### Caret ranges ``^A.B.C``
Matches to compatible versions.

###### Examples
* ``^1.2.3`` := ``>=1.2.3 <2.0.0``
* ``^0.1.2`` := ``>=0.1.2 <0.2.0``
* ``^0.0.1`` := ``>=0.0.1 <0.0.2``

##### Tilde ranges ``~A.B.C`` ``~A.B`` ``~A``
If patch version is specified tilde ranges matches to all greater or equal versions with the same minor version. Otherwise is equivalent of ``A.B.*`` when minor version is specified or ``A.*.*`` when not.

##### Hyphen ranges ``A.B.C - X.Y.Z``
Hyphen range ``A.B.C - X.Y.Z`` equivalent of ``>=A.B.C <=X.Y.Z``.

### Prerelease versions
Prerelease versions can satisfy comparators set only when have the same minor major and patch numbers as at least one of comparators.
